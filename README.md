Cleaning the Data:

Removal of unnecessary columns.
Cleaning and standardizing the "Date of Publication" column.
Cleaning and standardizing the "Place of Publication" column.
Extracting author information from the "Title" column.
Exporting Cleaned Data:

Visualization:

Displaying a histogram of the publication years.
Giving the user a choice to visualize data in different ways:
Number of books per author.
Number of books per city (place of publication).
Exploring correlation between place and publisher.
User Interaction:

The script prompts the user to choose the type of graph they want to visualize and allows for multiple visualizations until the user chooses to exit.
Considerations in Data Cleaning:

Handling different date formats in the "Date of Publication" column.
Cleaning and standardizing the "Place of Publication" column, including handling variations and non-ASCII characters.
Extracting author information from the "Title" column, considering various formats.
Output:

Cleaned data is saved in both CSV and Excel formats.
Visualizations provide insights into the distribution of publication years, number of books per author, and distribution of books across cities.
Note: The script is designed for interactive use, allowing users to explore different visualizations based on the cleaned dataset. The cleaned dataset is saved for further analysis.
